ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning with Machine Learning Precision
This project features a curated dataset sourced from Kaggle and meticulously cleaned using powerful machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
âœ… Why it matters:
Raw data is messy, inconsistent, and often unusable in its original form. By applying intelligent preprocessing techniquesâ€”handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical dataâ€”Iâ€™ve transformed this dataset into a reliable foundation for analysis and modeling.
